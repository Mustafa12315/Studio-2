This repo is to add a small feature to the game, Whispers of the Dead. The goal is to specifically make use of one item each within the locations of: Pharmacy and Convenience Store.
At the moment these locations have multiple items, none of which have any use currently within the game, I plan to make use of the food/water you find at the pharmacy and the
medical supplies found within the pharmacy. This will be helpful for the game as there are two NPCs within the game, one is injured and would appreciate medical supplies and the other
can make use of food and water, these NPCs also give you a key and a hint to beat the game but even though they are in a distressed state, they ask nothing of you,
this fork will change that.
DON'T MERGE THE STORY YET
